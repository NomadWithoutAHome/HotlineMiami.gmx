This is communist persecution!

I think it's reasonable to assume that these killings are part of a secret anti-communist organization working to rid our nation of left wing politics and supporters. If you look at the names and occupation of all the victims they have either been Russian or politically active pro coalitionists. The war clearly isn't over, anyone who hasn't been brain washed by the right wing protesters can easily make the connection here; it's fairly obvious!


Re: This is communist persecution!

You somehow fail to mention that all the victims have been associated to organized crime, and that any politicians caught up in this mess may very well be collateral damage. I think you're trying to hard to force your own political agenda into your deduction. This place is not the place to be discussing politics, there's way better places for you if that's what you're after!


Re:Re: This is communist persecution!

Hey now, let's not completely rule out his theory. Failing to explain certain aspects of these cases doesn't automatically disprove anything!


Re:Re:Re: This is communist persecution!

"His" theory? Did you completely rule out that I could be a woman? Women are just as capable of using modern technology as men, I'll have you know. 

Furthermore I have heard from sources that wish to remain anonymous that at least two of the five dead dead suspects were known members of an underground anti-coalition organization tightly linked to the KUA. But go ahead, stick your head in the sand if you want!


Re:Re:Re:Re: This is communist persecution!

And we're supposed to trust your "anonymous sources"? Why has none of the news outlets mentioned a word about this, then? The gosh darn Russians practically own them all by now. You'd think something like that might be of interest to them, no?


Re:Re:Re:Re:Re: This is communist persecution!

It's quite possible they don't want to have people associate organized crime with communism, isn't it? Not that anyone could possibly have failed to notice what influence the Russian culture has had on our society anyways.

Can't say I'm buying the persecution angle though... Seems a bit far fetched if you ask me.



What are you doing here? // Who are you people?

-Think of it as a game...

-You're one of our pawns aren't you?

-I guess this means game over

Who are you people?

-You don't know? Haha, that's pathetic!

-I thought you had us figured out by now

-Make a guess, asshole

-Not that it makes any difference now, does it?

Who are you working for? // You're the voices on the phone?

-No one, haha

-We're independent, we did it all ourselves

-Hard to believe isn't it?

You're the voices on the phone?

-What a stupid question! You really need to ask?

-What does it look like to you, asshole?

-You don't know anything do you?

You think this is a game? // Why are you doing this?

-Don't you?

-You mean you haven't enjoyed it?

-That's a shame, haha

Why are you doing this?

-We were bored, that's why

-Why would we need to justify our actions?

-You've done far worse things than we have, haven't you?

-Besides, Do you know how much money we're making?

How do you justify killing people? // You mean this has all been pointless?

-We haven't killed anyone, you have.

-They were all scum anyway, weren't they?

-You think they deserved to live? Do you?

You mean this has all been pointless?

-If you say so

-If you don't understand why we're doing this...

-Then why should we tell you?

That's it? // Any last words?

-Haha, you seem dissappointed?

-What were you expecting?

-I think we're through with your questions

-Yeah, let's get this over with

Any last words?

-How about "fuck you"?

-Yeah, fuck you!


Why are you doing this?
--------------------------------
J:You wanna know why?
We're bored, that's why!

D:No one else seem to be doing
anything interesting in this city.

J:You mean you haven't enjoyed 
doing what we've told you to do?


You think it's ok to force random 
people to kill strangers?
--------------------------------
J:Why not? It's not like we're
targetting innocent people...

D:We've practically erradicated
organized crime in Miami.

J:Yeah, we're not the real villains
here. If anything we're heroes...


How did this whole thing start?
-----------------------------------------
J:Have you never let anyone
control your actions before?

D:Have you never wanted to be
the one controlling others?

J:It's not as hard as it seems.
All you need is a little pressure!

D:We weren't really expecting
things to go this far...

J:It's amazing what a little
intimidation can get people to do.


Is that really all there is to it?
--------------------------------------
D:Well, then there's money also.
You can have some if you want...

J:We've got more money and drugs
than we need by now, really.

D:Criminals in Miami sure do seem
to pack some serious pocket money.


Any last words?
---------------------
J: Well, yeah
...
Fuck you!

D:Yeah, up yours dude!
